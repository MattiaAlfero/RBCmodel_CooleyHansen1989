# The Real Business Cycle (RBC) model - Cooley and Hansen 1989

##### This project aimed at solving and showing the solution of a simple real business cycle model based on Cooley and Hansen 1989. The pdf introduces you to the model and the optimization problem faced by households and firms. In the same report, it is shown how the FOCs and the equilibrium equations are retrieved. Finally, since the solution method is based on Klein (2000), we log-linearize the equilibrium conditions, and we put them in the state space form.

##### The jupyter notebook starts from the state space, importing it in python. Then a function based on Klein 2000 is used to extract the policy and transition functions. Finally, we simulated the economy with different money growth, in order to extract statistics about variability and correlation with output. The final table can be compared with the table in Cooley and Hansen 1989.

##### Feel free to send me a message in case of errors in the code/report, or just to talk about dynamic models.
